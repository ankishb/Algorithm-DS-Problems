Data Science, drawing from Statistics and Machine Learning has focused on stochastic models of data and analysis (mainly empirical) of simple algorithms for big data problems. The Algorithms and Data Science research at MSR India brings in the best of all worlds. A focus of ours has been developing mathematical models under which simple algorithms (often ones used widely in practice) have provable guarantees of time and space. Researchers currently at MSR India started the use of sampling from the input to speed up matrix algorithms and this remains one of their interests. Research has also led to better understanding of simple widely used models and algorithms like K-means, gradient descent, alternating minimization, submodular minimization, Topic Modeling and a host of areas. Learning and Optimization areas which have interesting and relevant models and problems.

Some research themes of our focus include

    Massive Matrix Computation, including randomized and distributed PCA-like problems
    Low rank approximations to Tensors
    Streaming Algorithms
    Property Testing
    Clustering
    Large Scale (distributed, stochastic) Optimization



Theory of Machine Learning

Machine Learning algorithms and optimization techniques have become central to most applications of computing ranging from search, ads, data-mining, data-analytics in large databases, information retrieval and extraction, natural language processing including machine translation, speech, vision, gaming, user adaptation of computing systems, as well as security, privacy, and the broad topic of crowd-sourcing. Our goal is to conduct research in theoretical and practical aspects of Machine Learning and Optimization including:

    Novel machine learning algorithms and paradigms
    Foundational aspects of optimization techniques, including new algorithms and applications to machine learning
    Theoretical analysis of machine learning and optimization algorithms
    Performance analysis and enhancement of machine learning and optimization algorithms
    Applications in search and IR, vision, NLP and other areas
    Data mining and data analytics for very large data sets





Understanding, analyzing and processing data is at the core of building most of the modern large scale systems and intelligent applications. We work on various aspects of data-driven algorithms including fast machine learning algorithms that can learn from large scale and noisy data, learning from natural language and multilingual data, and applications of these algorithms to Web Search, Computational Advertisement, Recommendation Systems, Natural Language Systems, Music Retrieval, etc. Some of the current focus areas of the group are:

    Learning from a large number of data points including distributed machine learning, single box learning at scale, and streaming algorithms.
    Learning from a large number of dimensions including high dimensional statistics, low rank and sparse learning, dimensionality reduction and feature selection.
    Learning from a large number of tasks including extreme classification, learning bandits with a large number of arms.
    Hashing and dimensionality reduction techniques for multilingual technologies, including cross-language text search/classification, transliteration, spelling normalization and fuzzy search of entities.
    IR and NLP techniques for code-mixing and script-mixing.
    Text mining techniques for harvesting experiential knowledge from natural language data.
    Music retrieval and recommendation.

## Most Imp
There are some things which Bing does better than Google, like Contextual Searching and Predictions and its evolving fast as a search engine, although Google is still better, but Bing is improving each day and Microsoft is spending a lot on Bing, so the job profile is very challenging and interesting.


Microsoft Bangalore office has 3 floors. One of which is occupied by Microsoft research Group(MSR). 2nd and 3rd floor is IDC. Currently, the Bangalore IDC office houses the entire Bing Ads team, and a small team from the Server and Tools Business division, which was actually an acquisition and a portion of Dynamics CRM.



here are some teams which claim to be part of Azure BigData also in Bangalore.
The problem there is they are mostly working as support and config changes team and have horrifying work ethics. So be very careful in joining such teams.


Microsoft IDC Hyderabad is the biggest campus for Microsoft outside of US. This is important to mention because there is lot of ownership from India. Office for Android is shipped from Hyderabad. Some of core Azure teams, a large number of products in OFFICE, Office 365, Cortana, Bing, AI and Research team, Dynamic CRM and my team which works on Visual Studio and Visual Studio Team Services are all in Hyderabad campus. Also Bangalore office do have team working on CosmosDB and other Big data stuff.



## Contextual Search
- Contextual search services differ from current search engines based on traditional information retrieval that return lists of documents based on their relevance to the query. 
- contextual search attempts to increase the precision of results based on how valuable they are to individual users.
- Exp: what is the cost of a laptop? What adding $ sign in the end, add a context that look prices in dollars
- what is contextual search? But adding sth like reference or abstract in the end, indicates that search for research paper. It will prioritize the result for research paper first

## 
Bing takes into account three qualities in it’s ranking calculation: a website’s topical relevance, the context, and the content quality. Topical relevance asks how related to the query is a website page, in other words ““Does it address the query?” Context analyzes specific and historical information about the user and the query, such as whether the query might be about a recent popular topic, what the user’s physical location is, the user’s search history, etc. Lastly, and most importantly, content quality investigates three important questions: “Can we trust this content?”, “Is the content useful and sufficiently detailed?”, and“Is the content well-presented and easy to find?”


## Bing team
- structuring queries
    for exp: search for allen,
        - person name, institute name, like that
- another relevent queries
    - there is also relevenet queries, website wise
    - for exp, you search for sth, now you choose some website, below that wesite link, there will be similar queries, which you may want to refer

## Outlook team
- this is personal information manager
- mainly mail, calender, tasks, notes, journouls, web browsing

## office
- presentation layout(recommend)
- text correction and imrpove
- search on web browser to get relevant material
- insight feature (excel from dataset)
- picture alignment
- 3d model animation
