Data Science, drawing from Statistics and Machine Learning has focused on stochastic models of data and analysis (mainly empirical) of simple algorithms for big data problems. The Algorithms and Data Science research at MSR India brings in the best of all worlds. A focus of ours has been developing mathematical models under which simple algorithms (often ones used widely in practice) have provable guarantees of time and space. Researchers currently at MSR India started the use of sampling from the input to speed up matrix algorithms and this remains one of their interests. Research has also led to better understanding of simple widely used models and algorithms like K-means, gradient descent, alternating minimization, submodular minimization, Topic Modeling and a host of areas. Learning and Optimization areas which have interesting and relevant models and problems.

Some research themes of our focus include

    Massive Matrix Computation, including randomized and distributed PCA-like problems
    Low rank approximations to Tensors
    Streaming Algorithms
    Property Testing
    Clustering
    Large Scale (distributed, stochastic) Optimization



Theory of Machine Learning

Machine Learning algorithms and optimization techniques have become central to most applications of computing ranging from search, ads, data-mining, data-analytics in large databases, information retrieval and extraction, natural language processing including machine translation, speech, vision, gaming, user adaptation of computing systems, as well as security, privacy, and the broad topic of crowd-sourcing. Our goal is to conduct research in theoretical and practical aspects of Machine Learning and Optimization including:

    Novel machine learning algorithms and paradigms
    Foundational aspects of optimization techniques, including new algorithms and applications to machine learning
    Theoretical analysis of machine learning and optimization algorithms
    Performance analysis and enhancement of machine learning and optimization algorithms
    Applications in search and IR, vision, NLP and other areas
    Data mining and data analytics for very large data sets





Understanding, analyzing and processing data is at the core of building most of the modern large scale systems and intelligent applications. We work on various aspects of data-driven algorithms including fast machine learning algorithms that can learn from large scale and noisy data, learning from natural language and multilingual data, and applications of these algorithms to Web Search, Computational Advertisement, Recommendation Systems, Natural Language Systems, Music Retrieval, etc. Some of the current focus areas of the group are:

    Learning from a large number of data points including distributed machine learning, single box learning at scale, and streaming algorithms.
    Learning from a large number of dimensions including high dimensional statistics, low rank and sparse learning, dimensionality reduction and feature selection.
    Learning from a large number of tasks including extreme classification, learning bandits with a large number of arms.
    Hashing and dimensionality reduction techniques for multilingual technologies, including cross-language text search/classification, transliteration, spelling normalization and fuzzy search of entities.
    IR and NLP techniques for code-mixing and script-mixing.
    Text mining techniques for harvesting experiential knowledge from natural language data.
    Music retrieval and recommendation.
