I've worked at Microsoft for 13 years, with most of that time as a Program Manager, and I've both interviewed and conducted interviews throughout my years. I walk through what a typical interview day looks like, how many interviews you'll have, give some sample questions, walk through a good way to structure a response, and talk about how I assess a candidate.

A good way to structure an interview question response using the STARS format:
 • Situation - What's the background?
 • Task - What were you responsible for?
 • Activity - What did you actually do?
 • Result - how did things turn out?
 • Self-aware - what would you have done differently?
