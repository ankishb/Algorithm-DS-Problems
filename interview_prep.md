## Selection Procedure :

1) Visa :
● Online Test, Coding + MCQ (75 mins). There were two simple coding problems and MCQs were based on Machine Learning, Networking, OS, Application Security, Programming (OOP and Java), etc.
● Three rounds of interviews

My first interview was scheduled at 6:00 am. I reached a bit late and waited for about an hour and finally went in at 7:00 am. The first round (40 mins) was based on resume and was mostly technical. The first few questions were on OOP and software development cycle, etc. I told him that I do not know about these since I was targeting for the data science profile. I was asked about projects and a few questions were on fast fourier transform algorithms, how to efficiently invert a sparse matrix, big data and optimization. The second round (30 mins) was HR which was being conducted by a foreigner. He asked me questions about my short term and long term goals, how technology is going to transform our future, etc. The third round (5 mins) was again HR where I was asked about team work, compensation, relocation, etc.

2) Opera :
● Resume Shortlist
● Written Test (20 objective and 5 subjective in 1 hour) based on probability, combinatorics and puzzle-based
● 2-4 rounds of interviews

There were four rounds of interview.

● First : Three puzzles. First - On a globe, you do following – go 1 mile south, go 1 mile east, and then go 1 mile north. Is it possible that final point is same as initial point? How many such initial points exist for which this is possible? Second – Gurmeet puzzle Q.30 Fifteen sum problem. Third – How can 3 people calculate average of their salary without explicitly telling their exact salary?

● Second : One case – A retail chain (eg. Reliance Fresh, Spencer, etc) has identified a location for a new outlet. You are a hired consultant to help them decide if they should open the outlet or not. Then he asked me about my thoughts about the Opera placement screening test followed by a few questions on team management: What would you do if a specific person is trying to dominate and have his way in the team?, etc.

● Third : A guesstimate – Amount of water used in IIT Kanpur campus. 4 questions on probability ranging from simple to average. Eg: There are three doors. One goes straight to heaven, one goes to hell and sends you back after 1 day, and the last one goes to hell and sends you back after 2 days and the doors are shuffled randomly after you come back. What is the expected number of days until you reach heaven?

● Fourth : Telephonic round. Guesstimate : if cars are to be stacked from New York to New Delhi, how many would be required?

3) Samsung Research :
● Resume Shortlist
● Two rounds of test, first was objective (60 questions; quant, verbal and DI; 20 each, simple) and second round was coding based (3 questions in 60 mins)

Do’s and Don’ts :

1) Be clear about your priorities and preferences. Also, keep in mind the specific slottings.
2) Start preparing as early as possible, summer is a good time.
3) Know your resume very well. Do not write unnecessary things that you cannot defend/explain.
4) In the interviews, try to relate your expertise/knowledge to your projects.
5) Aptitude and Coding preparation should be done sincerely even if you have a good profile for a company because shortlisting are based on these tests.
6) For non-CSE junta, get in ease with JAVA/C++. It helps in the coding tests, C can be limiting. 



## Very very intelligent person
Preparation is everything. Talent will only get you so far. At the very outset you have to be very clear what you’re aiming for and then work towards that goal. You can get a good idea of what role you’re interested in by talking to your seniors who are working in those companies. Don’t be hesitant in asking them even if you don’t know them properly. Believe me, all you have to do is ask.

Since I wasn’t aiming for non-core companies my preparation was targeted towards Quantitative and Software development roles. This is crucial for CSE students who have an inclination towards quantitative roles, you have to realize that there are only 2 companies that have these quantitative roles, Goldman Sachs and Tower Research, and all the remaining companies have software developer roles. So you have to balance out your perpetration and prepare for the software companies as well. That preparation will also help you out while interviewing with for the quant roles as well.

In order to prepare for the software developer role, the following sources are sufficient:
-LeetCode ( try and do all the 150 questions, the exam questions are very similar)
-GeeksForGeeks (do all the questions in the DS section and refer to it for subject -preparation as well)
-Introduction to Algorithms - Cormen (do the exercises)
-Solve problems on TopCoder (better than the other since it has an amazing editorial for each competition and you can view the solution in case you’re stuck)
-Cracking the coding interview - book

For the quantitative preparation refer to the following:
- CSE Blog - Pratik Poddar (awesome collection of puzzles)
- Cut the knot (the probability, pigeon hole principle and other maths sections)
- 50 challenging problems in probability
- Heard on wall Street
- Peter Winkler – Puzzles Connoisseur’s collection

The material you have to cover is a lot so I’d suggest that one should start early. The summer vacation is a good time to do so, because the semester can get very hectic with all the courses and the PPTs. You have to hone your coding skills since that is something everyone expects you to be good at. 


#####
Selection Tests :

Goldman Sachs :
We had our exam on 1st November. There are 2 parts to the exam, pen and paper exam. One objective part with 25 questions and one subjective part with 3 sections(Algorithms, Maths and Probability, Computer Science). Each of them are 75 minutes each. The objective part is easy but the subjective part is low scoring. Be careful about which sections you attempt in the subjective part since that decides what divisions you are considered for. Since I did not want the tech role I completely left out the Computer Science part (so that they don’t have any doubts about my interests). I did all the questions of the Algorithm section (there were 5) and 2 questions in the Maths section.

Microsoft :
Also happened in November. 15 objective questions and 2 coding questions. The objective questions were to be done in 25 minutes based on C++ and algorithms (not core subjects like OS or compilers surprisingly). 2 coding questions were:
- Mirror a binary tree
- Some question on bit-manipulation

Tower Research :
4 sections, pen and paper exam. Write exact working code questions; OS and hardware related questions; probability problems; Algorithm questions.

Interviews :

Goldman Sachs :
My interview were completely based on my resume. In the first two rounds of interview not a single technical question was asked. Just some basic puzzles like: Given 100 doors all closed if you toggle the state of all multiples of 1 then toggle the state of the multiples of 2 and so on… which doors will be finally open; Given points in a plane describe a data structure to find points within 1 km radius of any given input point; (since I had done regression analysis course) Find the Best linear unbiased estimate of parameters in a linear regression model; Basics of Convex Optimization; Spaghetti Puzzle : find expected number of loops in a spaghetti bowl with n strands if you randomly choose 2 ends and join them together; (this one was a tough one and I struggled a bit while solving this …. But the good this is that the interviewer helps you) Given a pile of n stones you randomly divide it into 2 stacks and multiply the size of the 2 stacks and note the value. Every time you divide the stack you multiply the sizes of the 2 stacks and then note the value. Then sum up all these values. What will this value be? (Ans: n(n-1)/2). There were a total of 5 rounds.

Microsoft :
There were just 2 technical rounds: Given an array with pointers to nodes of a n-ary tree with each node containing the parent Id as well. Reconstruct the original tree from the node. Also write down what the structure of the node will look like. The second round was: write a working code to merge 2 linked lists. Rest 2 rounds were HR rounds (poore funde sessions ). They gave a spot offer Microsoft US.

Tower Research : This was one of the toughest interviews I’d given. It went on for 2 hours. It was purely math and algorithm based. I had become so tired by then because of which I don’t remember the exact questions. But if you rigorously do the sites given above you’ll fare well. They have relatively high standards and did not take anyone finally. Be sure to perform really well in the test that increases your chances dramatically.

Do’s and Don’ts :
Remain calm because things like pre scheduling of interviews can happen and you shouldn’t let that affect you since you have prepared too much for this moment and now is not the time to panic.

Try to surround yourself with friends and maintain a positive attitude. Be friendly with the SPO representatives because they’ll help you A LOT with the interview scheduling. I credit my GS interview conversion to Archhit Jain who stuck by me while I was giving interviews of other companies. Don’t rush the interview and take your time.



## Amazon Interview Experience:
Now, straight to the questions:

Just identifying problems:

    To give you an idea about a data scientist’s role, usually one has to first identify a problem. Tell me how you would go after identifying a problem?
    How would you calibrate that the problem you have identified is one of the most important problems to solve?
    How will you propose a solution to this kind of problem?
    How would you find out what are the top ten money draining projects that the State of Wisconsin has launched in last 5 years?
    A more specific question: Imagine you are working for a giant hospital that operates in multiple cities. You have a week to take a look at all the data available that the hospital has collected. The data are available in SQL servers and elaborate SQL queries can be written. How would you go after proposing to the managing director on what to focus on?
    I have LinkedIn data available for a geography ~ Say Seattle. Anyone outside of this Geography has been filtered out. Now with remaining 4 million people, I want to find out how connected this network is. How will you formulate this problem?
    Lets say you work for Walmart Labs. Walmart wants to identify which geographies are not doing very well and would like to identify a few things it can do to improve the sales. How will you identify which geographies are not doing well?
        How will you rank them?
        How will you drill this down to the level of ZIP codes?
        How will you identify profitable ZIP codes vs loss making ZIP codes?
        How will you identify if this problem is getting worse over time?
    Walmart has a standard floor design. How will you make it better for future stores?
        How will you propose changes to the existing floor plan of Walmart?
        How will you rank 50 such changes?
        How will you test them?
        How will you setup a pilot to test this, and then improve based off the pilot?
    Imagine that Walmart has X thousand cashiers working for all stores in US. We want to launch self check out lanes, and also want to hire cashier associates. How will you find out where an optimum point exists for a particular store. How will you scale this to the entire US network?
    We have demographic data available for every state, ZIP code. We have sales numbers available for all states, but not ZIP codes. How will you figure out approximate sales figures for each ZIP code?
    Now that you have figured out that some of the ZIP codes are most profitable. You have to propose the next best locations of 10 Walmart stores. How will you identify these locations?

SQL type of questions:

I want to calculate mean, standard deviation, count, of a metric. Then for each item in the list I want to calculate how much percentage deviation occurs with respect to the mean. Write a simple SQL program that achieve this. I can setup a very simple table to do this, and then ask how someone is approaching this.

Python, R, Machine learning etc:

    How would you go after identifying which machine learning algorithm works the best for a model problem?
    I have a set of data collected over last one year. With knn clustering algorithm I want to identify the top 100 clusters and filter out all the remaining clusters. How will you achieve this? What hurdles will you get into? (This is so open ended that when a candidate begins answering one can drill down on what they are thinking and how they are approaching the problem)
    How does random forest algorithm work?
    Lets say I have data representative of house prices. There are 80 variables that define a house’s price. I want to predict the prices of 1000 houses based off the available data from 2000 houses. How will you come up with a model? And which algorithms can be used?
    Explain how ‘one-hot-encoding works’.
    Explain how linear regression can be made better?

Check out this one on modeling. I would certainly prepare these and model https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/...

Integer programming type of problems:

    I have three variables that can take values between 0 and 1. They are given in three columns. They are multiplied by X, and then sum of that multiplication is subtracted from Y given in another column called Col_Sum.
        The sum of the variables must be less than equal to 2 for each row.
        The sum of the Col_Sum must be maximized.
        How will you formulate this problem and how will you solve this?

Monte Carlo type of problems:

    How will you write a Monte Carlo type of solver for traveling salesman problem?

Math and scientific computing, probability etc:

    Explain how Fourier transforms work?
    How does Naive Bayes algorithm work?

Hope some of these pointers help the people wanting to prepare for interviews like these. Usually the time available in an interview is very little, but as soon as an interview takes a direction, it is easy enough to continue to dive deeper and deeper all the way to the point that one can be slicing and dicing an algorithm.

    One general advice is that you should try to explain things in simple words, with simpler models, and simpler techniques. Simplicity is always preferred, and your interview will certainly have a smoother sail.
    If should be able to draw things on charts quickly, so you should practice this.
    Statistics is foundation of data-science, and whether people know machine learning or not, they know statistics far better, so testing that knowledge is easier even for non-programmers.
    You should be able to tell stories on how you solved problems in your previous jobs, because almost 60–80 percent of the interview can simply focus on it.
    That being said, you should certainly review ton of other questions I have posted about Data-Science, Python, Machine learning and so on.
    Review “top data-science questions” on various websites.
