Nested Queries:
	We need employess names, which have buy things from seller with price more than 10,000 Rs. We have 2 table, one for employee(employees detail) and another with sales data.

1. Select all the emp_id from sales data using following query

SELECT sales.emp_id
From sales
WHERE sales.sales>10000



2. Now we got emp_id, use this to find their name from employees table. **Use IN keyword, where Another query will be inside ()**

SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name
FROM employees
WHERE employees.emp_id IN(
	SELECT sales.emp_id
	From sales
	WHERE sales.sales>10000
)


Q. Find the employee with highest salary
SELECT * 
From employees
WHERE salary = (
	SELECT Max(salary) 
	FROM employees
)

Q. Find the highest salary
SELECT Max(salary) 
FROM employees;


Q. Find the 2nd highest salary
SELECT * 
From employees
WHERE salary Not IN (
	SELECT MAX(salary)
	From employees
);


Q. Select range of employees
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE emp_id BETWEEN 2003 AND 2013
